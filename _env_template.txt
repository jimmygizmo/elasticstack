#  All env vars are strings anyhow and quotes make it explicitly clear and avoid other problems.
#  No "types" exist in env settings so treating any as such is a mistake. The configuration
#  which process the env should do all type-conversion smartly, setting smart defaults and failing
#  rather than making assumptions and coercing types carelessly.
