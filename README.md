# elasticstack

ElasticSearch and Kibana intended for standalone use or as a data layer for The Nucleus Stack. There is a plan to use an ELK stack variant initially for web traffic and React application log analytics for Nucleus and perhaps more. Nucleus will have the best possible traffic analytics. ElasticSearch and ELK stack are preferred technologies for this.

This project and repository is somewhat experimental but will always be kept as stable as possible and will be shaped in the direction of a plug in for The Nucleus Stack.
How that plug-in architecture works is still being designed but will of course involve Docker Compose and also Kubernetes. K8S configuration files, automation scripts, configuration templates and tools and instructions for multiple architectures are coming soon to this project as well as Nucleus.

Please also check out CassandraStack and KafkaStack. Each stack is designed to be valuable as a standalone development tool which can easily map to production architectures at any scale. Equally so, these stacks are designed to plug in to The Nucleus Stack and derived applications and production architectures.

Together, ElasticStack, CassandraStack, KafkaStack and the core stack, The Nucleus Stack can form the best and most modern Big Data, Data Science, distributed computing, machine-learning and other enterprise architectures, topped by beautiful and powerful React-based applications and data visualization.

Thank you for your interest in ElasticStack!
