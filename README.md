# elasticstack

ElasticSearch and Kibana intended for standalone use or as a data layer for The Nucleus Stack. There is a plan to use an ELK stack variant initially for web traffic and React application log analytics for Nucleus and perhaps more. Nucleus needs traffic analytics and ElasticSearch and ELK stack are preferred technologies for this.

This project and repository is somewhat experimental but will always be kept as stable as possible and will be shaped in the direction of a plug in stack for The Nucleus Stack.
Currently how that plug-in architecture works has not been finalized but will of course center around Docker Compose and also Kubernetes. K8S configuration files and instructions for multiple architectures are coming soon to this project as well Nucleus.

Kafka and Zookeeper in Docker containers. Proof of concept and experiment for using Kafka at scale in a distributed web app and ML environment.

Thank you for your interest in my ElasticStack project and The Nucleus Stack proejct.
